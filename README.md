Code for the paper "Reflection Equivariant Quantum Neural Networks for Enhanced Image Classification", Maxwell West et al. (arxiv: <https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00264>)

We implement image classifying quantum variational classifiers that are equivariant to (i.e. their predictions remain unchanged under) horizontal reflections of the images. We find that these models are able to outperform a generic ansatz despite their restricted expressivity. These results support an emerging trend in quantum machine learning of constructing task specific models that respect the symmetries of their target data.
